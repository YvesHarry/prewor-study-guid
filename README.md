# Ayti C (AC)

## AC is the abreviation for "Ayti C", a project that aims to reunite a people who share or appreciat Haitian's history, language, culture, food, and music.
- My main motivation is to build a plateform where people can get together and share ideas on how we can help/change Haiti.
- I build this project because it was much needed, especially in a moment where Haitians are so discouraged.
- The main problem this project solves is the negative image of Haiti at the international level.
- So far, I've learned that I need more skills than the ones that I'll acquire from the boot camp to finalize mhy project.
